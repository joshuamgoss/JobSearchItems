        description: "I started learning Swift mainly because I had an idea for an app that would help teachers with classroom management.  I worked through several example projects, and when I felt comfortable with the language and XCode I built a rough draft of the project.  Regrettably, I quickly realized that the type of data security required to comply with regulations would either outweigh the convenience to the user, require dedicated servers at the district level, or need memorandums of understanding signed with implementing districts along with a highly secure server.  Regardless, screenshots of the app running on the XCode iOS emulator are provided here, along with screenshots of the code and UI hierarchy in XCode.  Several of the code files are also available on my GitHub page, linked in the header.",

        description: "I started working with C# in late 2016.  I had dabbled a bit cobbling together Python to accomplish specific tasks in the few years prior, and had cut my teeth on Basic/QBasic back in the late 80s and early 90s, but C# was the first language that I really sat down to try and understand well.  I chose C# in order to be able to help the Video Game Design classes at the school where I worked, where Unity is the primary game engine they use.  In 2017, as a summer project, I built a 2D Metroidvania style game, creating all of the scripts, particle effects, and graphic resources from scratch.  I used GIMP and Blender for the graphics, though I do not claim to have any particular skill in that area.  I did not actively maintain that project, so it has broken in the last few Unity updates, but I have some snippets from that here.",

I have included a few screenshots from a project that I completed as part of an assessment for a course. \n The work screenshots show code quality, commenting practices, and unit testing.

The general structure is that you complete ranks by solving increasingly difficult coding tasks - typically consisting of writing a function that takes a certain type of input and returns some type of output. Here I have included examples from each of the coding languages listed above, and statistics from that website about my proficiency in each language.",
