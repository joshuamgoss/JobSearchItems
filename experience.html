    <h1>Experience</h1>
    A consistent thread through my career has been incorporating technology.  For two summers in a row 
    I ended up working with databases, and for the next several years incorporating several technologies
    and languages in my work as a research assistant.  I've been running an after school club that required 
    managing dual OS installations and drive partitions across 27 machines, and have been helping fill 
    in while the school looks for a new IT person.<br/><br/>
    <h3>Summer Work</h3>
    I worked for one summer at a logistics firm called BAX in their Phoenix office, specifically with the group that coordinated 
    with contractors that handled international freight arriving or departing by air.  My primary role was 
    maintaining both physical and digital records on the contractors' certifications, contract compliance, and 
    a number of other things. Most of what I did was updating a pre-established database and generating reports 
    for other members of the team.<br/>
    The next summer I worked for the consumer loans section of a regional bank in Michigan.  They had been 
    maintaining all of their files physically, and as the bank grew it was becoming problematic.  I mentioned 
    that I had worked with databases the previous year and they asked me to build something for them.  To that 
    point I had never even attempted something like that, but I agreed to try.  I was able to build everything 
    they needed including putting all of their form letters and internal reports together and splitting the
    back end from the front end.  After I left they hired someone with more expertise and she ended up rebuilding
    it a bit to make it more scalable and efficient.<br/><br/>
    <h3>Western Michigan University</h3>
    At WMU through coursework I worked a bit with R, MatLab, Maple, and LaTex.  Most of that was for courses
    and amounted to five or six weeks of using the basic functionality.  The main pieces of technology that I 
    used more extensively were SPSS during the two larger research projects I was involved in, and the presentation 
    software that the University used to make distance learning modules.<br/><br/>
    <h3>University of New Haven</h3>
    At UNH I taught the Discreet Mathematics for Computer Sciences class, and incorporated some basic programming
    tasks, particularly around big O notation and when looking at the relevance of formal logic and graph theory, 
    to computer programing.  I also taught in a 6th year program in digital media literacy for in-service teachers.<br/><br/>
    <h3>Wilbur Cross High School</h3>
    At Wilbur Cross High School I began working with our excellent computer science teacher to support her 
    teaching of Advanced Video Game Design and AP Computer Science.  Initialy it was mainly helping figure out and 
    plan the more mathematics-intensive pieces of the course (e.g. certain topics in vector/matrix arithmetic and rigid body motion). 
    As I've learned more I have become more involved in helping troubleshoot/debug demonstration pieces, student code,
    and picking apart online examples.  <br/><br/>
    For a little over the last year I have also been the facutly sponsor for the eSports club, which required 
    us to create and manage bootcamp partitions for one of the Mac Labs.  When people realized I was good at that 
    sort of thing I began helping out more and more with tech issues as they came up in my Academy.  When our IT person 
    left for another job earlier this year I began taking a more active roll in helping pick up the slack.<br/><br/>
