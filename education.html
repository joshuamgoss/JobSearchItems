            <h1>Education</h1>
            I believe that the greatest strength that I have is my ability to learn quickly and independantly.  My formal education has 
            helped me develop discipline, problem solving, and logical thinking.  My continued eduction has helped me become a 
            quick, independant learner.<br/><br/> 
            <h3>Formal Education</h3>
            I have completed BS, MA, and Ph.D. degrees in Mathematics Education.  The most obviously beneficial piece of that
            is that I do have an extensive background in Mathematics, and have benefited from an education that emphasises logical
            thinking and rigorous proof. I even began graduate school as a pure Mathematics major, and most of my elective credits
            were taken up by additional courses and sequences in graduate level pure math courses.<br /><br/>
            My formal education also placed a heavy emphasis on communication and teamwork.  As a doctoral student and later as an
            Assistant Professor, public speaking was a large part of my job.  I delivered professional development for several years 
            to large groups of teachers, spoke at conferences, and wrote research papers for publication.  Many of those projects
            involved large groups of people working together, often over great distances.<br/><br/>
            <h3>Continuing and Independant Education</h3>
            I started working towards expanding my understanding of issues around computer science when I began teaching at the University 
            of New Haven.  I had enjoyed the work in MatLab, R, LaTex, and Maple that came up occasionally
            through my formal education, but it wasn't until I began teaching Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Majors that I began 
            taking a more serious look.  I picked up what I could, mainly using pieces of Python as they became relevant, to tailor that class
            more towards the students' interests.  Unfortunately, before I could really focus on learning to code well, the Education department
            closed and I lost most of my free time in trying to transition out of the University setting.<br/><br/>
            Around three years ago my main hobby became computer programming.  I went through a quick SoloLearn course on C# and set about learning
            how to work with the game engine Unity.  I spent a year making small games, working through tutorials, and finally teaching myself
            enough Blender and Gimp so that I could design 3D characters, use motion capture libraries to animate them, capture the footage, then 
            cut the result into sprite sheets.  A little under a year after I wrote my first 'hello world' in C#, I finished writing the first level 
            in my hobby game project.<br/><br/>
            Since then I worked for a while on an augmented reality project, again in Unity, then decided to pick up a second coding language.  I 
            learned Swift mainly through working on small projects and bit pieces on the playground/console setting.  I then worked on getting into 
            XCode and figuring out how to make iOS apps.<br/><br/>
            In early 2018 I decided that I wanted to make a concerted effort to learn programming in a more rigorous, methodical manner with the 
            ultimate goal of changing careers.  I started taking as many of the free online courses that I could find.  I knew that I would
            need to learn Java in order to make use of some of the more readily available and well developed resources, so I started there.  
            Lately I've been focusing on web tools, and part of the reason for putting this resume website together was to gain more 
            hands-on experience using React and Bootstrap.<br/><br/>
            I think that my ability to work independantly, stay focused, and pick things up quickly are the greatest strengths
            that I will bring with me to my first job in my new chosen career.  My understanding is that every new position 
            has a bit of a learning curve, and I believe that my unique background will help me get up to speed quickly.
