        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I wrote my first ‘Hello World’ in the late ‘80s on a Tandy 1000. My whole family became obsessed. I remember
            my mom actually having to put a cap on the number of those little ‘cookbook’ style learn-to-code books that
            we could check out from the library, and the bargains we made to try and get a few extra. Since then,
            technology and the need to teach myself have been constant threads in my life.</p>

        <p>We moved around a lot, and a series of small rural schools without internet and fewer than a dozen computers
            in the building made it difficult to find opportunities to learn more. I still learned what I could. I would
            type assignments when I could, I would figure out how to put small algorithms together to ‘check’ my math
            homework, and I would use our barely-there dial-up connection to try and learn more.</p>

        <p>In the Marine Corps I worked as a fire support man in an artillery company. I was one of two that could get
            the computer-based indirect fire coordination system to work, took every opportunity to get the
            range-finding and laser designating systems out to the field, helped troubleshoot communications equipment,
            and even digitized the scheduled calls for fire for the larger joint exercises.</p>

        <p>During my undergraduate studies I often found technical work in the summer. I worked two summers on
            databases, mainly doing data entry the first summer, but the second summer putting a new database together.
            In that second year I worked for a bank for the first time, for a commercial loans department about which I
            knew nothing, building a database with all the related forms and reports which I had never studied or
            attempted. In the space of a few months, while splitting my time between the commercial loans department and
            filling in for a collections clerk that left unexpectedly, I taught myself what I needed to know to put it
            all together. I learned enough about how databases worked, built the table structures and relationships,
            split off the front end, built the forms for data entry, built the reports they needed, and built and
            scheduled monthly client letters. I did all this without taking a class, without having a more experienced
            person to consult, and without even an existing database to model mind from.</p>

        <p>In grad school I started out in a grant program to deliver professional development to math teachers in rural
            Michigan. The grant funds were cut back and the renewal stipulated that they needed to shift to distance
            learning, and they had no idea how to proceed. I started by reviewing existing platforms to see if there was
            something in place we could implement. Due to the technology available at the time, and the state of
            internet access in rural areas, an online only solution was not reasonable. We ended up putting together a
            mix of a few technologies that we used to create modules that could distribute using physical media. We had
            to make sure it ran on a variety of equipment and that it was user-friendly for the local teacher-leaders
            that would deliver the PD to small groups at the schools. This also allowed for the opportunity of having
            professors design learning opportunities for the teachers, but required us to coordinate and assist the
            faculty members in designing their modules. As there were only four of us on the grant – a professor emeriti
            with very limited knowledge of the technology, an administrative assistant, a curriculum focused graduate
            assistant, and myself – the bulk of the work coordinating with faculty, facilitating their work, and
            assisting with the more technical aspects fell to me.</p>

        <p>In working with the faculty members from a wide range of specialties, I wound up being exposed to a variety
            of different disciplines and the technologies specific to them. In particular I ended up with a solid
            background in R, SPSS, MatLab, and Maple before they came up in the graduate curriculum. With my background
            I was able to excel in the computational mathematics, probability, and statistics coursework and was asked
            to help in a separate grant program working on the assessment team collecting and analyzing implementation
            data on a textbook that was being developed. </p>

        <p>As an Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Mathematics Education at the University of New Haven (UNH) I was
            asked to teach the Discreet Mathematics courses for Computer Science majors due to my background in graph
            theory, probability/statistics, propositional logic, and computer programming. In teaching that class I
            learned a fair bit of python to use in student exercises, as that is what they were using in the
            concurrently enrolled CSCI course. I also ended up teaching in the Digital Media Literacy graduate program
            for one summer.</p>

        <p>Since then I have taught myself C# and the Unity engine in order to help with a course at Wilbur Cross and to
            work on hobby projects. I taught myself Swift and used that with XCode to begin work on a classroom
            management app, and shifted to working on Java when I became serious about making the career change to
            software development. I learned JavaScript/HTML/CSS to put together my website (which originally included a
            MongoDB NoSQL database, but were stripped out when I chose to host on AWS’s S3 environment), which also uses
            Bootstrap and React to make the code more modular and present a user-friendly environment on various screen
            sizes.</p>

        <h2>Current Project</h2>
        <p>Right now I am working on learning ASP.net Core. I am going to use a sample database that was a part of a
            TSQL course to make a mock-eCommerce website.</p>

        <p>In terms of getting the ‘bones’ of it all set up, it has been fairly straightforward. EF Core makes
            connecting the back end and front end fairly straightforward. I am using a database with only five
            tables. I wrote the data model classes, and then simply scaffolded the CRUD pages.</p>

        <p>I have been reading about how some people prefer to put the services in a separate class’ static
            method then call that in ConfigureServices (and another for the Configure method) to be ready for
            use as Dependency Injections (DIs). I definitely see how this would be advantageous in larger
            projects. The startup file gets a little long and crowded if you end up using a large number of
            services, and it gives you separate spaces that can focus on single purposes. It also makes it so
            that you can’t inadvertently mess up your services if you’re working on the HTTP request pipeline.
            My thought is that I will do this for ConfigureServices, but leave Configure’s code in Setup.cs. I
            very much like the idea of having all the services in their own dedicated area, but I don’t know
            enough about the overhead in moving the HTTP request pipeline out of that file, and I need to do a
            little more studying before I’m comfortable making a decision to move it.</p>

        <p>I have a lot to do with the scaffolded CRUD pages. They are a nice starting point, but there are
            several things that could certainly be done better. For instance, setting up a new customer and
            inputting their address should all be one page, but the scaffolding process put those
            separately. Things like that need to be addressed. It is giving me a lot of practice with
            dependency injections and the async/wait pattern, though, which is great.</p>
